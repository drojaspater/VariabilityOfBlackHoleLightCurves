#  Variability of Black Hole Light Curves: Analyzing Slow-Light and Fast-Light black hole movies with AART
This repository is dedicated to studying the variability in black hole light curves using the AART (Adaptive Analytical Ray-Tracing) code, originally developed and available at https://github.com/iAART/aart/. Here, we apply AART to reproduce key results from the paper “Adaptive Analytical Ray Tracing of Black Hole Photon Rings” using the “slow-light” mode, and then extend the analysis to the “fast-light” mode. By generating black hole movies and analyzing emission variability, this project aims to quantify potential measurable differences in light curves depending on the chosen light propagation mode.
